This is a way for pharmacies to deliver medicine to people who can't leave the house.
During social distancing, it's indispensable that the elderly stay inside so as to avoid risks as much as possible.
We believe the best way for them to receive their medicine is via delivery from the pharmacy.

How would it work for the pharmacy?
 - The pharmacy receives a request for a delivery
 - They verify that the address is correct
 - They verify that the medicine has not already been sent
 - They select the medicine from their inventory and deliver it
 - The delivery driver confirms that the medicine has been dropped off
   IN PERSON (not left on the front porch or etc.)

How would it work for the user?
 - They keep track of their prescriptions
 - On the pharmacy website, they somehow provide proof of who they are
 - They submit payment
 - Once they are approved, they receive a notification that the medicine is being delivered
 - Via the website, they can track the shipping
 - They get the medicine, and clear instructions for how to take it
